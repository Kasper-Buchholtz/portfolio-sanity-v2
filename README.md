This is an official Turborepo starter template for Superego Sanity projects.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `i18n`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
-
- `@repo/i18n`: a utility package for `app/i18n` 
- `@repo/link-field`: a package for a custom `LinkField` component
- `@repo/sanity-studio`: a fork of tinloof's sanity-studio
- `@repo/sanity-web`: a fork of tinloof's sanity-web
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `i18n` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/tailwind-config`: a shared `tailwind.config.ts` file for `web` and `i18n` applications

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first CSS
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing JavaScript and TypeScript code

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
